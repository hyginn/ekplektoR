}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A number.}

  general type of its arguments.
}
\description{

}
\details{
This is an inconvenience function that achieves exactly the same as the
\code{"*"} operator, which it uses internally, but with more characters to
type.
}
\section{QA warning}{
 Actually using this function instead of "*" will get you
  in trouble with QA.
