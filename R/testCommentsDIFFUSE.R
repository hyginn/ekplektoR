# Comments re: tests
#
#Test 1: Tests that errors are thrown under several erroneous conditions,
#        including: incorrect argument classes/types/modes, AGG that is not
#        igraph object, AGG missing gene score vertex attribute
#
#Test 2: Tests that correct edge scores are given given the test dataset
#        Dataset will be an AGG with appropriate attributes, including
#        gene scores for vertices, HGNC symbols for edges and vertices
#
#Test 3: Tests that correct attributes and metadata are attached to AGG,
#        including: "Influence" attribute in edges, EGG version graph attribute,
#       and all attributes expected of AGG
#
#Test 4: Tests that metadata is written to log file
