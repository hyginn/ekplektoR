#a given network, expected or produced by the FINDSUB function)
#If that condition is fulfilled, AND the nrow of the expected vertex set is the same as that of the
#output vertex set, then you know that the two data frames of vertices have identical contents, and
# by extension the network's iGraph object's vertices/attributes were added correctly

#Note:

#With a threshold influence of 3.5, LMN5 OPQ6 RST7 should form a network,
#ABC1,DEF2,GHI4,JKL3 should form a network
#When this is lowered to 3, LMN5,OPQ6,RST7,UVW8,and XYZ9 should form a network
#ABC1 DEF2 JKL3 GHI4 from same subnetwork
#Lower further to 2, and the 'discovered subnetwork' will include all vertices, but not all edges
#Lower influence threshold (delta) to 1, and every edge included
