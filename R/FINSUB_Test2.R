#a given network, expected or produced by the FINDSUB function)
#If that condition is fulfilled, AND the nrow of the expected vertex set is the same as that of the
#output vertex set, then you know that the two data frames of vertices have identical contents, and
# by extension the network's iGraph object's vertices/attributes were added correctly
