#Like FINDSUB_Test4, but setting edge weights such that after edge removal, a path will exist between
#GHI4 and XYZ9 going in both directions, and consequently UVW8 and XYZ9 are included in a strongly connected
#subnetwork with ABC1:GHI4

#Here, we will be assigning an edge influence attribute of 5 to edge GHI4->XYZ9, and an
#edge influence attribute of 5 to edge XYZ0->GHI4
#ABC1 DEF2 JKL3 GHI4 and  should form a network of 6 nodes and LMN5, OPQ6, RST7 should form
#a subnetwork of 3 nodes.

#The main purpose of this test is to show that construction of subnetworks can involve grouping
#edges that are not grouped together i.e. consecutive in the list

#vertCompar: because of how unique() sorts things, you can get your vertices out of original order

#is present in the output vertex data frame (by vertex dataframe I mean dataframe for vertices of
#a given network, expected or produced by the FINDSUB function)
#If that condition is fulfilled, AND the nrow of the expected vertex set is the same as that of the
#output vertex set, then you know that the two data frames of vertices have identical contents, and
# by extension the network's iGraph object's vertices/attributes were added correctly
