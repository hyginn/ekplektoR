#DIFFUSE Function

#' Diffuse heat across edges and weight edges by heat
#'
#' @param AGG annotated gene graph (AGG), an igraph object with the following: vertices, with
#' gene name attribute, gene score attribute; edges (directed) with gene names corresponding to
#' 'source' and 'receiver' vertices
#' @param algorithm Method of distributing influence. Currently only "Leis" method, describing heat
#' diffusion process from Leisseron et al. (2015) available. Future versions of this function
#' may have additional methods. Once influence is distributed from a gene based upon its initial
#' 'gene score' (see score function for details), edges directed from the gene are assigned
#' the 'influence' calculated for them. See details section for more information
#' @param param list of parameters for algorithm, defaults to a list containing 'rete.beta',
#' a globally set option (see documentation for options()). See details section for more information
#' @param silent if TRUE, suppress printing of process to console
#' @param writeLog if FALSE, suppress logging of run and object metadata to rete's log
#'
#' @return  EGG (igraph object with content equivalent to AGG, but with an influence attribute
#' for edges)
#'
#' @details The purpose of the function is to take an AGG input, and, depending on the algorithm,
#' assign directed influences from one vertex to another based on network topology and a given
#' vertex's gene score. For the Leis method, the following procedure is followed: 1) calculate
#' the matrix W(i,j) as 1/deg(j) if there is a directional edge from j to i, 2) calculate matrix F
#' as Beta * inverse(I-(1-Beta)*W), where W is the transition matrix as described before, I is
#' the identity matrix of dimensions (number of vertices x number of vertices), and Beta is an
#' 'insulation' parameter, 3) calculate matrix E as F*D, where D is a diagonal matrix where every
#' element (i,i) is the 'heat' score/gene score for vertex(i), 4) from each E(i,j) that is not
#' equal to 0, assign the value E(i,j) to the directional edge going from vertex j to vertex i.
#' A more precise definition of the model E=Beta*inverse(I-(1-Beta)*W)*D is a random walk where,
#' if one starts from node j, the probability of moving onto another given node will be
#' (1-Beta)*1/deg(j), where Beta is the probability of restarting from the start node. If this
#' process is repeated ad infinitum, a stationary distribution of F=Beta*inverse(I-(1-Beta)*W)
#' is reached, where in each column j of matrix F, a vector of probabilities is given for landing
#' on each element (i) in the column; i.e. element i of column j represents the probability of
#' reaching node i if a random walk starts from node j. Thus, element E(i,j) represents the
#' probability of reaching node i from node j when at stationary state multiplied by the initial
#' 'heat' (gene score) put on node j. For all E(i,j) where there exists a directed edge from
#' j to i, edge j -> i is equal to the value of E(i,j).
